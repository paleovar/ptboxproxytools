\title{Calculate spatial mean of a climate data field}
\usage{
spatial_means(lon, lat, clim_field, weighting_field = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{lon}{Vector of longitudes}

\item{lat}{Vector of latitudes}

\item{clim_field}{Climate data field (with dimension #lon x #lat)}

\item{weighting_field}{Field with additional weights for grid boxes if additional constraints should be included in weights (e.g., fractional land area). Default is NULL}
}
\value{
Number (spatial mean)
}
\description{
Calculate spatial mean of a climate data field
}
\examples{
# Create dummy field
lon <- seq(0,90,by=10)
lat <- seq(0,70,by=10)
clim_field <- matrix(1:80,nrow=10)
# Compute spatial mean
clim_mean <- spatial_means(lon,lat,clim_field)
# Print spatial mean
print(clim_mean)
